## 2. Disclaimer & External Links

ClipTrigger (“the App”) is an **unofficial, community-driven overlay** built with the Overwolf SDK.  
It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by** Overwolf Ltd., Psyonix LLC / Epic Games (Rocket League), Riot Games, Google LLC (YouTube™) or any other trademark holder.  
All product names, logos and brands are property of their respective owners.

External links (e.g. YouTube videos) lead to third-party content over which we have no control; the respective provider is solely responsible.

### 2.1 User-generated Clips & Acceptable-Use Policy

- **User responsibility.** You are fully responsible for every clip, screenshot or media file you create, upload, stream or share via ClipTrigger.
- **Rights & licences.** You confirm that you **own or have secured all necessary rights** to any content you post or broadcast, or that such content is expressly free to use (licence-free, public-domain, fair-use, etc.).
- **No liability.** ClipTrigger, the developer (Simon Rambow) and contributors **accept no liability for the legality, accuracy or decency** of user content.
- **Prohibited content.** The App may **not be used** for:
  - illegal content (child sexual-abuse material, extremist propaganda, unlicensed copyrighted works, etc.)
  - pornography or sexually explicit content aimed at sexual arousal
  - gratuitous real-world violence, gore or hate content.

  Violations can lead to deletion of content, suspension of features or—where required—reports to the authorities.

- **Streaming & public display.** When you stream or publish clips you must comply with the Terms of Service of the relevant platform (e.g. Twitch, YouTube), local broadcasting laws and rights of all parties depicted.

### 2.2 Advertising & Premium Service

ClipTrigger may stay free by showing **Overwolf Ads** (video & banner).

- Ads are delivered by Overwolf; we do **not receive personal data** about you. Overwolf may use device identifiers or locale settings (see their privacy policy).
- A planned **Premium subscription** will remove third-party ads.
- Ads will never block core gameplay UI; audio is muted by default unless you choose otherwise.

You may **not copy, modify, distribute, sell or sublicense** any part of the ClipTrigger source code without prior written permission.
